# Habit Quest Clone UI Project

- When two devs come together and create something to talk about. Project concept and design by Web Developer/Web Designer Melvin Torres and developed by me Davonne Vigil.

# Goal ðŸŽ¯

- Got the opportunity to work with Web Developer/Web Designer Melvin Torres to bring his UI design to life. It was also an awesome idea. It is a site where developers can go to track thier habits, share thier story, have community, while utilizing AI and generate a unique story based off habits. Quite an awesome concept, if you ask me.

- My goal was to turn Melvin's Figma UI Design into living breathing UI code. Focusing on his design and coding it how its designed but with my own twist and styles to it. I was able to test my skills when it comes to all things React.js and Tailwind CSS. It was awesome working with Melvin, I hope to work with him again in the future.
