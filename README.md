# Habit Quest Clone UI Project

- When two devs come together and create something to talk about. Project concept and design by Web Developer/Designer Melvin Torres and developed by me Davonne Vigil.

- This was a fun project turning Melvin's Figma UI Design into living code. Adding my own styles and twist to the project. I was able to test my skills when it comes to all things React.js and Tailwind CSS.
