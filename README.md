# Habit Quest Clone UI Project

- When two devs come together and create something to talk about. Project concept and design by Web Developer/Designer Melvin Torres and developed by me Davonne Vigil.

This was a fun project turning his Figma Web Design into Reality. Testing my skills when it comes to all things React.js and Tailwind CSS.
